Hey!

I'm Tal Maimon, I have been a software engineer for over 10 years.
I decided to open this blog because I was inspired by my good friend [Lior](https://xrl1.sh/)'s blog.
I will mainly write about technological stuff, such as projects I'm working on or interesting research I come across.
My goal for this blog is to become a place that inspires ideas and motivates its readers.
Well that and to actually be able to maintain this blog.

As of writing this paragraph (10/05/2023 if you're interested) I mostly dabble in machine learning. However, since my attention span is pretty limited, there are no guarantees.

I'm always open to conversation, so if you find one of my posts interesting or feel that something is lacking, you're more than welcome to send me an email, as that is the best way to reach me.

Thanks for reading this,

Tal.
